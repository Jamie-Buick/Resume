    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
    I am a highly motivated graduate who has completed a dual Master of Engineering program achieving a MEng
    Electronic Engineering from Ulster University with 1st class honours and a MEng Mechatronic Systems at Augsburg
    Horschule with 1st class honours. Through my studies, work experience and final year project I have gained
    important knowledge on engineering principles that are essential in all engineering environments.
    </p>

    <p>
    From my final year project and work experience I have significantly improved my skills in schematic design,
    component selection and PCB layout. My final year project consisted of designing and prototyping an energy
    harvesting system which was used to power a wireless sensor node. I have a high level of hand soldering gained
    through building and fault finding PCBs. I learned of the importance of teamwork and communication and how this
    benefits the engineering environment. I learned how to meet deadlines, of multiple tasks, in an organised manner
    which has improved my productivity and work standard. I believe that I have the skills and knowledge to work
    professionally within any engineering environment
